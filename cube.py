The purpose of this program is to compute the surface area of a cube.
The input is an floating-point number representing the lenght of the edge of a cube.
The output is a floating-point number labled as the  surface area of a cube.
"""

length = float(input("Enter the length of the edge of a cube: "))
area = 6 * length ** 2
print("The surface area of the cube is", area, "square units.")
